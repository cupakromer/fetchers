Apprentice Homework Assignment
==============================

Tasks
-----
1. Look through http://programmableweb.com for publicly-accessible APIs
   that I'd like to experiment with. Write a class like the sample
`Fetchers::Stock` provided that pulls data from them and converts the
results into a hash.

2. If I'm feeling really ambitious, sign up for a Microsoft Bing Maps
   Key, and write a class that counts the number of severe traffic
incidents occurring in and around Baltimore, MD. The Bing traffic API is
documented here:

Chosen APIs
-----------
* #### Vimeo ####

  Chosen as it has a public API that does not require registration. Also
allows for requesting data in JSON format.

* #### Etsy ####

  Requires a registration and API. Wanted to try my hand at using an API
key at the same time creating something my wife could potentially use.
